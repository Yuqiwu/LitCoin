      <h2> How do people earn Bitcoin? </h2>
      <ul>
	<li> There's no easy or foolproof way to make substantial amounts of bitcoin fast and "free bitcoins" don't exist. </li>
	<li> Micro Earnings (pay to click websites, bitcoin faucets, Micro Jobs)
	  Bitcoin faucets are a website or an app that function as reward system. They dispense satoshis (a hundredth of a millionth BTC) which can be claimed by completing a captcha or task. </li>
	<li> Advertising/Writing about BitCoin (BitcoinTalk Signature Campaigns, writing for blogs and news-sites) </li>
	<li> Providing bitcoin-related services (website manager, graphic design expert, etc...) </li>
	<li> Bitcoin affiliate marketing </li>
	<ul>
	  <li> Promote a product, and receive bitcoin for each sale you help make. </li>
	</ul>
	<li> Open a faucet/rotator </li>
	<li> Trading (Day trading, CFDs, binary options) </li>
	<ul>
	  <li> Bitcoin-trading app CoinBase </li>
	  <li> Day Trading: buying and selling bitcoin on the same day (depends on small, short-term price fluctuations). </li>
	  <li> CFD (contracts for difference): Similar to day trading but you don't have to actually "buy" the bitcoin, you just buy a contract for it (so you don't have to deal with holding or storing it). You can short sell for a profit. </li>
	  <li> Binary Options: predict whether the value of bitcoin will increase or decrease in a given time period. If your prediction is correct, you earn the payoff. If it's wrong, you lose your investment. </li>
	</ul>
	<li> Some companies actually pay their employees in BitCoin and other cryptocurrencies </li>
	<ul>
	  <li> (eliminates the middleman, no geographical limitations, etc...)</li>
	</ul>
	<li> Mining </li>
      </ul>

      <h2> How are new BitCoins created? </h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Bitcoins are generated by a competitive and decentralized process called "mining".  </li>
	<li> "Miners" are process and verify transactions, securing the network with specialized hardware. </li>
	<li> The first miner to verify the transaction receives a certain amount of bitcoins as a reward. </li>
	<li> The Bitcoin protocol is designed in such a way that new bitcoins are created at a fixed rate. </li>
	<li> This makes Bitcoin mining a very competitive business. </li>
	<li> When more miners join the network, it becomes increasingly difficult to make a profit and miners must seek efficiency to cut their operating costs.  </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2> What is mining? </h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Computers (called "miners") verify transactions to create a verified box </li>
	<ul>
	  <li> This means that they "package" recent transactions in blocks (unfakeable units) </li>
	  <li> This is like when a credit card company verifies that you have available funds. </li>
	</ul>
	<li> It requires A LOT of computing power, which it's pretty impractical to mine for yourself. </li>
	<ul>
	  <li> The mining process is too energy-intensive to sabotage the blockchain. </li>
	</ul>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2> How does BitCoin function while decentralized? </h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Everyone has their own ledger. </li>
	<li> Everytime a transaction occurs, it's broadcast to the world so everyone can add that line into their ledger. </li>
	<li> But how can we make sure that everyone is receiving the broadcast in the same order? </li>
	<li> How can we trust that the transaction is real? </li>
	<li> We determine it by computation power. Which involves the blockchain. </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2> Blockchain </h2>
      <ul>
	<li> A block contains several transactions (2,400) and a special number. </li>
	<li> Miners have to find a special number that when combined with the block, and put into a SHA256 method, it will give you a number with 60 0s in front. </li>
	<li> The amount of 0s in front does not have to be 60, it depends.
	</li>
	<li> Then it will broadcast the block to everyone else. </li>
	<li> Then to reward the first miner, we will give them some rewards. That is mining. </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2> Computation Power </h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Then why can we trust computation power? </li>
	<li> As a rule, we assume the longest blockchain is the most updated one.
	</li>
	<li> A person may try to forge one block or several blocks. But because creating a block necessitates finding that special number, it takes a lot of computation power to forge. </li>
	<li> A person may be lucky enough to get a few blocks. But there are a bunch of other miners trying to create a block. So the forger cannot create blocks as fast as the rest of the world. </li>
	<li> So after several blocks, there ends up being enough information to be sure which blockchain is the real one. </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2> Special Number </h2>
      <ul>
	<li> For the special number, it does not need to give you a hash number with 60 0s in front. </li>
	<li> In fact, it changes periodically that will take around 10 minutes for miners to get that number. </li>
	<li> When there are more and more miners, the number of 0s in front will increase. So the probability of you finding that number will decrease. </li>
	<li> Why? Because the probability of finding a hash number with n 0s in front is 2^n. </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2> Reward </h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Miners will get a fix number of bitcoin as reward. But this number decrease geometrically over time. </li>
	<li> Right now the reward is 12.5 bitcoins. </li>
	<li> This means the total number of bitcoin will never be over 21 millions. </li>
	<li> Miners will also get a transaction fee that is left by the broadcaster because they want the miner to include their transactions into the block since each block has a limited transaction (2,400) </li>
      </ul>
